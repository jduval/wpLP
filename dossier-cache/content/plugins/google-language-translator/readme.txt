Welcome to Google Language Tranlator! This plugin allows you to insert the Google Language Translator tool anywhere on your website using shortcode.

== Description ==

Settings include: inline or vertical layout, show/hide specific languages, hide/show Google toolbar, and hide/show Google branding. Add the shortcode to pages, posts, and widgets.

== Installation ==

1. Download the zip folder named google-language-translator.zip
2. Unzip the folder and put it in the plugins directory of your wordpress installation. (wp-content/plugins).
3. Activate the plugin through the plugin window in the admin panel.
4. Go to Settings > Google Language Translator, enable the plugin, and then choose your settings.
5. Copy the shortcode and paste it into a page, post or widget.
6. Do not use the shortcode twice on a single page - it will not work.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

== Changelog ==

1.1 The shortcode supplied on the settings page was updated to display '[google-translator]'.

1.2 Shortcode support is now available for adding [google-translator] to text widgets.  I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

1.3 HTML display problem in the sidebar area now fixed. Previously, inserting the [google-translator] plugin into a text widget caused it to display above the widget, instead of inside of it.

1.4 Corrected display problems associated with CSS styles not being placed correctly in wp_head.  

1.5 Added "Original Language" support to the plugin settings, which allows the user to choose the original language of their website, which ultimately removes the original language as a choice in the language drop-down presented to website visitors.

1.6 Added "Specific Language" support to the plugin settings, which allows the user to choose specific languages that are displayed to website visitors.

1.7 Modified google-language-translator.php so that jQuery and CSS styles were enqueued properly onto the settings page only. Previously, jQuery functionality and CSS styles were being added to all pages of the Wordpresss Dashboard, which was causing functionality and display issues for some users.

1.8 Modified google-language-translator.php to display the correct output to the browser when horizontal layout is selected.  Previously, it was not displaying at all.
